# Resume
A repository containing my latex file with github-actions set to create a PDF and push it to `gh-pages` branch which is then hosted so I can easily update my information in latex, push the changes and expect my updates to be reflected in the hosted version of this repo with no hassle.  
You can check it out here [rutvik-j.github.io/resume](https://rutvik-j.github.io/resume/)

#### Special mention
